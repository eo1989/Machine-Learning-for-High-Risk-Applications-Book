# Code for Chapter 6: Chapter 6. Explainable Boosting Machines and Explaining XGBoost

This chapter explores interpretable models and post-hoc explanation with examples relating to consumer finance. It also applies the approaches discussed in Chapter 2 using explainable boosting machines (EBMs), monotonically constrained XGBoost models, and post-hoc explanation techniques.
